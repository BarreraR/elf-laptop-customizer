# Laptop Customizer
_Starter project for React course_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Begin this task by breaking down the user interface into components and drawing them as a hierarchical tree. You should be able to identify at least 6 components - possibly even more! Once you are satisfied with the component organization, take some time to plan out where the state(s) of the app will live. Finally, create the component files you will need, and move the existing code into those files.
